## Data
The data used has been obtained with the API used in the third project. It includes all the launches since 1961 until nowadays, including the planned for the next months.

Once the data from the launches was obtained, I have created another CSV file that includes for each location its coordinates (latitude and longitude).

## Project Description
TBD
